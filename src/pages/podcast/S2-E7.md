This week Michael and Rob chat with Middlesex batsman and red-ball captain Steve Eskinazi who spoke very openly about his journey to becoming a pro-cricketer, the thrilling finale to the 2016 season, and Middlesex's struggles since then. Of course, after the events at the Gabba in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the pair also have a quick dig at the Aussies, before reviewing England's first test win vs Sri Lanka.
