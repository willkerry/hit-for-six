Michael and Rob are joined by cricket lover and Pakistan fan, Murtaza, to review a thrilling first test between England and Pakistan. The trio reflect on who played well, who underperformed, and how that leaves the rest of the series. Michael also finds time to make yet another plug for Adil Rashid to return to the test arena, and there is also a brief discussion on Ireland's victory in the final ODI.
