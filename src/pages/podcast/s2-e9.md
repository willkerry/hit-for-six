This week Michael and Rob are joined by former Middlesex fast bowler and cricket broadcasting legend Simon Hughes. They discuss Simon's autobiography (and Michael's favourite ever cricket book) "A Lot of Hard Yakka", his career as a player, how he came to be "The Analyst" for Channel 4's cricket coverage and the virtual cricket club he's been involved in during lockdown.
