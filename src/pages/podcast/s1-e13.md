This week, Rob and Michael are joined by former England opener and Worcestershire legend Tim Curtis. Tim scored over 20,000 First Class runs in a hugely successful professional career in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and until recently held the position of Vice President at Worcestershire CCC. Highlights and lowlights of his own career, and the state of domestic cricket in England are the topics up for discussion as the boys welcome their second former Test cricketer as a guest in as many weeks!
