This week Michael and Rob are joined by TMS commentator Daniel Norcross as they discuss England's ignominious defeat in Ahmedabad. Was it the pitch, the ball, good bowling or poor batting? How biased are the Indian commentators and is that a bad thing? Is the World Test Championship a worthy enterprise? And how did Daniel make it all the way from Test Match Sofa to Test Match Special? All this and much more is discussed in this wide-ranging conversation about the sport we all love.
