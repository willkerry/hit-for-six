This time around Rob and Michael are joined by cricket writing, playing and broadcasting legend Vic Marks! After a very successful playing career with Somerset and England, Vic became the cricket correspondent for the Observer, and has remained writing for both them and the Guardian ever since. A much-loved contributor to Test Match Special as well, it's safe to say that Vic is one of Michael and Rob's heroes. He came on the pod to discuss his recent book, Original Spin, and chat about his life in cricket over the past 40 to 50 years.
