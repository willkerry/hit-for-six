It certainly wasn’t the summer we were expecting but, despite the Coronavirus pandemic, it’s been a fine summer of cricket to reflect back on! In this penultimate episode of the season, Rob and Michael pick over England’s disappointing series defeat to Australia before discussing their player and moment of the summer, and briefly previewing the Bob Willis Trophy Final between Somerset and Essex.
