Episode 2 of the new series sees Michael and Rob speak to fellow University of Warwick alumni and TMS Producer Adam Mountford. Tales from the summer's International Cricket bubble, the lucky break that got him into broadcasting, and reflections on the free-to-air television debate are all served up in this lively and good-natured interview with the man who runs cricket radio broadcasting for the BBC!
