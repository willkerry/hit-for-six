Hit for Six is BACK!! Michael and Rob catch-up with former England wicketkeeper and current Leicestershire CCC Head Coach Paul Nixon. They chat about Nicoâ€™s career, life as a county coach during lockdown and reflect on the future of the sport - including the challenges of match-fixing and corruption. Passionate about the game and always up for a laugh Nico also has a couple of cracking anecdotes to lift any mid-winter blues.
