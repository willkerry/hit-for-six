This week Michael and Rob are joined by former England Cricket and Olympic Chaplain Rev Andrew Wingfield-Digby. A fine cricketer in his own right, Andrew played first class cricket for Oxford University and the Combined Universities XI, and also captained Dorset in the Minor Counties Championship. He later went on to be a chaplain for the England Cricket team, as well as chaplain at three Olympic Games! All of this and more is recounted in a wide ranging interview, as the trio speak about the time he brought Minor Counties cricket into disrepute to how identity and sport interlink.
