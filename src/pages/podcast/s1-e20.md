Following a highly entertaining series victory over Australia in the T20s and with the ODI series in full swing, Michael and Rob spent Saturday morning reviewing England's white ball success. From the outstanding form of David Malan to who should be picked for the T20 World Cup next year, and of course how good Adil Rashid really is, the pair cover the major talking points coming out of the limited-overs Summer!
