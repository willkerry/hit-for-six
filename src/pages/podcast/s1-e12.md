Former England Test Captain, Sky Sports Pundit, and Times Cricket Correspondent. Our special guest for this week needs no introduction...He's watched every player we've selected in our XI on countless occasions and so was perfectly placed to review our dream England side from the past 20 years. In this episode, he gave his thoughts on our selection and threw a few of his own names into the mix as well!
