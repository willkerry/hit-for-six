Earlier this year, Rob and Michael selected their England Test XI of the 21st century. A team full of some of the biggest and best names English cricket has ever produced. But what about some of those lesser known and quickly forgotten players? Those one test wonders and stop-gap selections? Joined by Nick Harris and Linus Pardoe, Rob and Michael go about selecting an alternative England XI made up of rogue characters, last-minute fill-ins, and statistical failures. The result is a side so unbalanced, it would be fitting of any England selectors meeting!
